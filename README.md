Project done for Cofilife during May-June 2024 
This is a datacraping and analytics project wherein I scraped data from Pinterest using selenium module.
Statistical Analysis and Sentiment analysis was done on the data.

Pinterest Data:
Image titles and URLs were scraped of desired #hashtags from pinterest.py
Additional hashtgs were extracted from Image titles and analysed in analysis_pinterest.ipynb

Facebook Data:

Data was cleaned to have selected attributes required for analysis in analysis_facebook.ipynb
Data was analysed to see which hashtags were popular based on  view counts, like counts, share counts
Sentiment analysis was done on the text which was associated with the hashtag.
